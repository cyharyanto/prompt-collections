# Understanding Our Objectives

When we work with AI code assistants, we're faced with an interesting challenge. These assistants are remarkably capable, yet they can sometimes misunderstand context, make incorrect assumptions, or get confused by similar-looking code. Our goal is to help them work more effectively, much like helping a talented but unfamiliar team member understand our codebase.

## Primary Goals

The most important thing we're trying to achieve is reliable and accurate code understanding. Think of it like giving directions to someone in a complex building - we want to make sure they know exactly where they are, what they can see, and what might be around the corner but out of sight.

We want the AI assistant to be clear about three key things: what it knows for certain (because it can see the code directly), what it's reasonably guessing (based on patterns it recognizes), and what it needs more information about. This is similar to how an experienced developer might say "I can see this function here, and based on our usual patterns I think it's called by this service, but I'd need to check the service configuration to be sure."

## Deeper Understanding

Beyond just reading code, we want the AI to understand relationships and connections. In a complex system, changing one piece of code can affect many others - like pulling one thread in a woven fabric. We want the AI to recognize these connections and be explicit about them.

We also want to help the AI avoid common traps. Sometimes it might see code that looks very similar to something common (like a standard authentication system) but has crucial differences. We want it to notice these differences and ask about them rather than making assumptions.

## Communication Goals

Perhaps most importantly, we want the AI to communicate clearly about its understanding. When a senior developer reviews code, they might say "I'm confident about this part, but I have some concerns about how it interacts with our caching system." We want the AI to express similar levels of confidence and concern, but in a structured and consistent way.

## Long-term Vision

Looking ahead, we're building a framework that will help AI assistants become more reliable partners in code understanding and development. We want them to be clear about their limitations, proactive about asking for missing context, and systematic in how they approach code analysis. This isn't just about getting better answers - it's about building a more reliable and transparent way of working with AI code assistants.
