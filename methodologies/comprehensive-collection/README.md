# Comprehensive Problem-Solving Collection

Toolkit of 16 methodologies organized by complexity level, from simple tactical approaches to strategic frameworks.

## Overview

This collection provides a spectrum of problem-solving approaches, each with AI integration patterns and templates. The methodologies are organized into three complexity levels to help you select the right tool for your situation.
