# ðŸ§  Problem-Solving Methodologies

This directory contains frameworks for systematic decision-making and problem-solving, from simple tactical approaches to strategic methodologies.

## Directory Overview

### ðŸ”´ Meta-Dialectical Methodology
**Location**: `meta-dialectical/`
**Best for**: Strategic decisions, value conflicts, high-stakes choices

Methodology derived from academic research on cognitive computing systems. Uses structured opposition to develop solutions that survive meaningful challenge.

- **Framework**: Methodology guide
- **Examples**: Applications
- **Templates**: Decision templates
- **AI Integration**: Human-AI collaboration patterns

### ðŸ”µ Comprehensive Collection
**Location**: `comprehensive-collection/`
**Best for**: Toolkit of 16 methodologies organized by complexity

Problem-solving toolkit with methodologies categorized by complexity level:

- **Surface-Level**: Five Whys, Fishbone, Pareto, PDCA, FMEA
- **Mid-Level**: Root Cause Analysis, Systems Mapping, TRIZ, Theory of Constraints
- **Deep Structure**: Dialectical Method, Double Loop Learning, Critical Systems Heuristics

### ðŸŽ¯ Selection Guide
**Location**: `selection-guide/`
**Best for**: Choosing the methodology for your situation

Tools and frameworks to help you select the problem-solving approach:

- **Decision Tree**: Flowchart for methodology selection
- **Complexity Matrix**: Matching problem complexity to method level
- **Quick Reference**: Method selection

## Quick Start Guide

### For Tactical Problems (Clear cause-effect)
1. **Five Whys** - Root cause analysis
2. **Pareto Analysis** - Focus on vital few issues
3. **Fishbone Diagram** - Cause exploration

### For System Issues (Process improvement)
1. **Root Cause Analysis** - Investigation
2. **Theory of Constraints** - Bottleneck identification
3. **Systems Mapping** - Understanding interactions

### For Strategic Decisions (Complexity/ambiguity)
1. **Meta-Dialectical** - Navigate tensions and trade-offs
2. **Cynefin Framework** - Classify problem type
3. **Double Loop Learning** - Challenge assumptions

## AI Integration Philosophy

All methodologies include patterns for human-AI collaboration:

- **Human Direction**: You define tensions and values
- **AI Exploration**: AI systematically explores implications
- **Structured Critique**: AI provides devil's advocacy
- **Human Synthesis**: You own final decisions and integration

## Getting Started

1. **Assessment**: Use selection guide to identify your problem type
2. **Simple Start**: Begin with surface-level methods for routine issues
3. **Build Complexity**: Progress to sophisticated methods as needed
4. **Document Process**: Track reasoning for future reference

## Academic Foundation

The meta-dialectical methodology is derived from:

**Haryanto, C. Y., & Lomempow, E. (2025).** *Cognitive Silicon: An Architectural Blueprint for Post-Industrial Computing Systems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.16622. [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.16622](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.16622)

This research developed structured approaches for creating productive friction to expose blind spots and navigate core tensions in complex systems.
