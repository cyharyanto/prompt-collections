# Code of Conduct

## Core Principles

This project adheres to four core principles that guide all contributions and interactions:

1. **Human-Centered Technology**: AI serves to augment human capabilities, not replace human judgment
2. **Responsible Innovation**: Technical advancement balanced with ethical consideration
3. **Inclusive Collaboration**: Diverse perspectives enhance collective understanding
4. **Evidence-Based Claims**: Factual grounding and appropriate qualification of all assertions

## Standards of Conduct

All participants commit to creating a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Expected Behavior

- Demonstrate empathy toward other community members
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what is best for the community and field
- Show courtesy and respect in all interactions

### Unacceptable Behavior

- Sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome advances
- Trolling, insulting comments, and personal/political attacks
- Public or private harassment of any kind
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Claiming ungrounded capabilities for AI systems
- Advocating for autonomous AI decision systems without human oversight
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Human-AI Collaboration Guidelines

When discussing or documenting AI systems:

1. **Accuracy Principle**: Be precise about AI capabilities and limitations
2. **Agency Clarity**: Clearly distinguish human and AI roles/responsibilities
3. **Authority Framework**: Maintain human decision authority in all systems
4. **Transparency Requirement**: Document all relevant constraints and considerations
5. **Value Alignment**: Ensure all proposed implementations align with human values

## Enforcement

Project maintainers enforce these standards by removing, editing, or rejecting contributions, comments, commits, code, issues, and other activities that violate this code of conduct. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team, who will review and investigate all complaints.
