## The Evolution of Software Engineering

Software engineering has constantly evolved toward higher-level abstractions that increase productivity and expand what engineers can build. Prompt engineering represents the latest evolutionary step in this progression:

| Era | Paradigm | Engineer's Focus |
|-----|----------|------------------|
| 1940s-50s | Hardwired Programming | Physical wiring and circuits |
| 1960s-70s | Punch Cards & Assembly | Machine-level instructions |
| 1980s-90s | Desktop Applications | APIs and libraries |
| 2000s-10s | Cloud & Mobile | Services and platforms |
| 2020s+ | LLM-Augmented Development | Intent and system architecture |

### The True Purpose of Software Engineering

Beyond functionality, software engineering is about:
- **Augmenting human capability and experience**: Creating tools that enhance what people can accomplish
- **Ethical responsibility**: Ensuring innovation respects privacy, security, and societal impact
- **Knowledge integration**: Combining domain expertise with technical implementation
- **Future-proofing**: Building systems resilient to evolving needs and contexts

### The Critical Paradigm Shift

LLMs enable a fundamental shift in how we approach software development:
- **Intent Translation**: LLMs excel at bridging human intent and machine execution
- **Abstraction Elevation**: We're no longer constrained to thinking at the syntax level
- **Knowledge Leverage**: LLMs encode vast software patterns and practices
- **System-Level Thinking**: Focus on architecture and what systems should do rather than how they do it

## Understanding the Framework

Our framework builds understanding progressively through interconnected documents across multiple domains. Each builds upon foundational concepts, similar to learning any new skill by first understanding core principles before moving to specific applications.

### Foundation Documents

We begin with understanding [mental models](docs/fundamentals/mental_models.md) of how LLMs work and their [limitations](docs/fundamentals/limitations.md). These documents help you build a solid foundation for effective prompt engineering in any domain.

Our guides on [context management](docs/fundamentals/context_management.md) and [evaluation](docs/fundamentals/evaluation.md) provide essential techniques applicable across all LLM interactions.

### Prompt Patterns

The framework includes proven prompt patterns that work across domains:

- [Chain of Thought](docs/prompt_patterns/chain_of_thought.md) for complex reasoning tasks
- [Few-Shot Learning](docs/prompt_patterns/few_shot.md) for teaching by example
- [Role Prompting](docs/prompt_patterns/role_prompting.md) for specialized expertise
- [Format Control](docs/prompt_patterns/format_control.md) for structured outputs

### Domain-Specific Guidance

Specialized guidance for different application areas:

- [Coding](docs/domains/coding/methodology.md): Effective code generation, understanding, and refinement
- [Writing](docs/domains/writing/content_creation.md): Content creation, editing, and style adaptation
- [Data Analysis](docs/domains/data_analysis/data_exploration.md): Working with datasets and extracting insights
- [Education](docs/domains/education): Creating learning materials and educational interactions

### Advanced Topics

For more experienced practitioners:

- [Retrieval-Augmented Generation](docs/advanced/rag.md): Combining LLMs with external knowledge
- [Multimodal Prompting](docs/advanced/multimodal.md): Working with images, audio, and text
- [System Design](docs/advanced/system_design.md): Building applications with LLMs
