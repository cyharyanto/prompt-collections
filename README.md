## Understanding the Framework

Our framework builds understanding progressively through interconnected documents across multiple domains. Each builds upon foundational concepts, similar to learning any new skill by first understanding core principles before moving to specific applications.

### Foundation Documents

We begin with understanding [mental models](docs/fundamentals/mental_models.md) of how LLMs work and their [limitations](docs/fundamentals/limitations.md). These documents help you build a solid foundation for effective prompt engineering in any domain.

Our guides on [context management](docs/fundamentals/context_management.md) and [evaluation](docs/fundamentals/evaluation.md) provide essential techniques applicable across all LLM interactions.

### Prompt Patterns

The framework includes proven prompt patterns that work across domains:

- [Chain of Thought](docs/prompt_patterns/chain_of_thought.md) for complex reasoning tasks
- [Few-Shot Learning](docs/prompt_patterns/few_shot.md) for teaching by example
- [Role Prompting](docs/prompt_patterns/role_prompting.md) for specialized expertise
- [Format Control](docs/prompt_patterns/format_control.md) for structured outputs

### Domain-Specific Guidance

Specialized guidance for different application areas:

- [Coding](docs/domains/coding/methodology.md): Effective code generation, understanding, and refinement
- [Writing](docs/domains/writing/content_creation.md): Content creation, editing, and style adaptation
- [Data Analysis](docs/domains/data_analysis/data_exploration.md): Working with datasets and extracting insights
- [Education](docs/domains/education): Creating learning materials and educational interactions

### Advanced Topics

For more experienced practitioners:

- [Retrieval-Augmented Generation](docs/advanced/rag.md): Combining LLMs with external knowledge
- [Multimodal Prompting](docs/advanced/multimodal.md): Working with images, audio, and text
- [System Design](docs/advanced/system_design.md): Building applications with LLMs
- [Ethics](docs/advanced/ethics.md): Responsible use of AI language models
