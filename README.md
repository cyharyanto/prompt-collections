When we work with AI code assistants, we're engaging with powerful but constrained tools. Think of them as highly capable team members who start fresh with each conversation, excel at pattern recognition, but need careful guidance to work effectively. This framework helps you understand these tools deeply and work with them productively.

## Understanding the Framework

Our framework builds understanding progressively through interconnected documents. Each builds upon the previous ones, much like how we might learn a new programming language by first understanding its core concepts, then its specific features, and finally its advanced applications.

### Foundation Documents

We begin with [objectives.md](docs/objectives.md), which explains our goals in working with AI code assistants. Just as you'd want to understand the purpose of a new tool before using it, this document helps you understand what we're trying to achieve and why it matters.

From there, we move to [assumptions.md](docs/assumptions.md), which explores the technical constraints we're working with. This is similar to understanding the capabilities and limitations of any tool – just as a database has specific performance characteristics we need to work within, AI code assistants have specific characteristics we need to understand.

### Deep Understanding

[limitations.md](docs/limitations.md) takes us deeper into understanding how AI systems differ from human developers. This isn't about listing what AI can't do – it's about understanding how to work effectively with AI's different way of processing and understanding code.

In [evaluation.md](docs/evaluation.md), we explore how to assess whether we're using these tools effectively. This framework helps us move beyond simple "working/not working" assessments to understand the nuances of effective AI assistance.

### Practical Application

[methodology.md](docs/methodology.md) bridges theory and practice. Here's where we take our understanding of AI's capabilities and constraints and turn it into practical workflows and approaches.

Finally, [tailoring.md](docs/tailoring.md) helps us adapt our approaches for different AI models. Just as we might use different debugging techniques for different types of applications, we need different approaches for different types of AI assistants.

## How to Use This Repository

Think of learning to work with AI code assistants as similar to learning a new programming paradigm. Here's how to progress through this material effectively:

1. Start with the Foundation
   - Read [objectives.md](docs/objectives.md) to understand our goals
   - Study [assumptions.md](docs/assumptions.md) to grasp the basic constraints
   - These documents provide the mental model you'll need

2. Build Understanding
   - Move on to [limitations.md](docs/limitations.md) to deepen your understanding
   - Use [evaluation.md](docs/evaluation.md) to learn how to assess effectiveness
   - These help you think critically about AI assistance

3. Apply Your Knowledge
   - Study [methodology.md](docs/methodology.md) for practical approaches
   - Use [tailoring.md](docs/tailoring.md) to adapt to different models
   - Practice with the examples provided in each document
  
## Analysis Protocols

This framework includes structured protocols for AI code analysis that ensure consistent, thorough, and reliable results. These protocols cover:

1. Context Management
   - Systematic verification of code completeness
   - Clear identification of context boundaries
   - Explicit tracking of dependencies

2. Analysis Methodology
   - Evidence classification and confidence signaling
   - Relationship mapping and validation
   - Domain-specific analysis approaches

3. Quality Assurance
   - Structured verification processes
   - Bias mitigation strategies
   - Comprehensive edge case consideration

These protocols are detailed in our methodology documentation and implemented through specific interaction patterns described in our practical guides.

## Contributing

When contributing to this framework, think of yourself as helping to build a comprehensive guide for working with an emerging technology. We welcome contributions that:

   - Add cross-references between related concepts
   - Explain how different aspects of the framework interact
   - Provide real-world examples that tie concepts together

2. Improve Understanding
   - Add clear, concrete examples
   - Provide step-by-step explanations
   - Create troubleshooting guides
   - Develop example dialogues

3. Enhance Practicality
   - Add implementation guides
   - Create decision frameworks
   - Share best practices
   - Document common pitfalls and solutions

See our [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidance.

## Future Development

We're working to enhance this framework in several key areas:

1. Model-Specific Guidance
   - Creating detailed guides for specific AI models
   - Developing comparative analyses
   - Building model-specific best practices

2. Educational Resources
   - Developing progressive learning paths
   - Creating interactive examples
   - Building comprehensive case studies

3. Integration Patterns
   - Designing team workflows
   - Creating code review guides
   - Developing collaboration patterns

## Quick Start

If you're just beginning to work with AI code assistants:

1. Read [objectives.md](docs/objectives.md) first to understand what we're trying to achieve
2. Review [assumptions.md](docs/assumptions.md) to understand basic constraints
3. Start applying the practices in [methodology.md](docs/methodology.md)
4. Refer to other documents as needed for deeper understanding

Remember that working with AI code assistants is a skill that develops over time. Don't expect to master everything at once – focus on building your understanding progressively and applying what you learn in practical situations.

## Getting Help

If you encounter challenges or have questions:

1. Check the relevant document's troubleshooting section
2. Look for similar examples in the documentation
3. Create an issue describing your specific situation
4. Contribute your learnings back to help others

By working together and sharing our experiences, we can build a more effective framework for everyone working with AI code assistants.
