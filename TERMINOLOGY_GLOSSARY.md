## Usage Guidelines

1. Always use terms as defined in this glossary for consistency across documentation
2. When introducing new concepts, check if appropriate terminology already exists
3. If creating new terms, add to this glossary with precise definitions
4. Maintain parallel structure in related term groups
5. Update hyperdense reference documents when terminology changes

This glossary serves as both a reference document and a governance tool for maintaining conceptual integrity throughout the repository. All terminology should align with the human-centered AI collaboration philosophy that centers human judgment, expertise, and decision authority while using AI capabilities as tools for augmentation.
