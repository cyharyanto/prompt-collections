# Case Study: Debugging a Complex React Application

This case study demonstrates how prompt engineering techniques were applied to effectively debug a React application with performance issues.

## The Challenge

A team was experiencing significant performance problems with their React application:
- Slow initial page load (5+ seconds)
- UI freezing during user interactions
- Memory usage growing over time
- Rendering inconsistencies across browsers

The codebase had approximately 75,000 lines of code, multiple third-party dependencies, and custom state management. Traditional debugging methods were proving time-consuming with unclear results.

## Prompt Engineering Approach

The team used a systematic prompt engineering approach to work with an AI assistant to diagnose and solve the issues:

### 1. Initial Problem Framing

```
I'm debugging performance issues in a React application. The app becomes increasingly sluggish over time, especially after navigating between routes.

Key details:
- React 17 with functional components and hooks
- Custom state management (not Redux)
- ~75K lines of code across ~200 components
- Heavy use of useEffect hooks
- Multiple data-fetching operations

What systematic approach would you recommend to identify the root causes? What initial areas should I investigate?
```

This prompt established the problem context without overwhelming the AI with too much code initially.

### 2. Progressive Context Addition

As the AI suggested specific areas to investigate, the team shared targeted code snippets:

```
Based on your suggestion, I'm examining our main dashboard component that might have memory leaks. Here's the component code:

```jsx
function Dashboard() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState(defaultFilters);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  
  // Component code with useEffect, event handlers, etc.
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      setIsLoading(true);
      try {
        const response = await api.getItems(filters);
        setData(response.data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to fetch data:', error);
      } finally {
        setIsLoading(false);
      }
    };
    
    fetchData();
    const intervalId = setInterval(fetchData, 30000);
    
    // Missing cleanup?
  }, [filters]);
  
  // Rest of component...
}
```

What potential issues do you see in this implementation that could cause memory leaks or performance problems?
```

### 3. Solution Validation

For each potential solution, the team used specific prompts to validate the approach:

```
You suggested adding a cleanup function to the useEffect hook. I've implemented it like this:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    // Same as before
  };
  
  fetchData();
  const intervalId = setInterval(fetchData, 30000);
  
  return () => {
    clearInterval(intervalId);
  };
}, [filters]);
```

Are there any issues with this implementation? Could it still cause problems if filters changes frequently?
```

### 4. Systematic Issue Tracking

The team created a structured approach to track and prioritize the identified issues:

```
Based on our debugging session, could you create a prioritized list of the performance issues we've identified so far? For each issue, please include:

1. A brief description of the problem
2. Potential impact on performance (high/medium/low)
3. Root cause
4. Recommended solution
5. Complexity of the fix (easy/moderate/complex)

This will help us plan our optimization work effectively.
```

## Results

Through this systematic approach, the team identified and resolved several key issues:
- Memory leaks from uncleared intervals and event listeners
- Unnecessary re-renders due to improper dependency arrays
- Expensive calculations being repeated on each render
- Network waterfall effects from nested data fetching

Performance improvements:
- Initial load time reduced by 60%
- UI responsiveness improved significantly
- Memory consumption stabilized
- Consistent performance across browsers

## Key Lessons

1. **Progressive disclosure** was more effective than sharing large code blocks at once
2. **Systematic diagnosis** using a structured approach led to comprehensive problem identification
3. **Validation prompts** ensured that solutions were properly implemented
4. **Suspending assumptions** about the root causes led to discovering unexpected issues
5. **Utilizing chain-of-thought prompting** helped trace complex interactions between components

## Prompt Patterns Used

1. **Context Building**: Starting with high-level information and progressively adding details
2. **Expert Consultation**: Positioning the AI as a specialized React performance expert
3. **Specific Question Focusing**: Directing attention to particular aspects of the code
4. **Solution Validation**: Requesting analysis of proposed fixes
5. **Systematic Summarization**: Creating structured overviews of issues and solutions
