# AI Research Assistant Workflow

This document demonstrates how to use a series of prompts to conduct comprehensive research on a topic.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Topic Exploration**: Generate an overview of the topic and identify key areas to explore
2. **Structured Inquiry**: Ask detailed questions about each key area
3. **Source Identification**: Identify credible sources to reference
4. **Information Synthesis**: Combine findings into a coherent summary
5. **Knowledge Gap Analysis**: Identify areas needing further research

## Step 1: Topic Exploration

```
# Topic Exploration Request

You are a knowledgeable research assistant with expertise in [DOMAIN].

I need to conduct research on [RESEARCH_TOPIC]. Before diving deep, please provide:

1. A concise overview of this topic (3-5 sentences)
2. The 5-7 most important subtopics or key areas that comprehensive research should cover
3. Why each subtopic is significant to understanding the whole topic
4. Any major debates or opposing viewpoints in this field

Focus on creating a strong foundation for deeper research.
```

## Step 2: Structured Inquiry

For each key area identified in Step 1:

```
# Detailed Subtopic Inquiry

Based on our previous discussion about [RESEARCH_TOPIC], I'd like to explore the subtopic of [SPECIFIC_SUBTOPIC] in greater detail.

Please provide:

1. Core concepts and definitions essential to understanding this subtopic
2. Historical development and how thinking has evolved
3. Current state of knowledge and recent developments
4. Practical applications or implications
5. Connections to other subtopics we've identified
6. 3-5 specific questions that would help deepen my understanding further

Aim for depth while keeping the information accessible.
```

## Step 3: Source Identification

```
# Source Identification Request

For my research on [RESEARCH_TOPIC], specifically the aspect of [SPECIFIC_SUBTOPIC], I need to identify credible sources.

Please suggest:

1. 3-5 seminal academic papers or books considered foundational
2. 2-3 recent peer-reviewed studies showing current developments
3. 1-2 literature reviews that provide comprehensive overviews
4. 2-3 credible non-academic sources for accessible information

For each source, please briefly explain:
- Key contributions to the field
- Why it's particularly relevant to my research
- Any potential limitations or biases to be aware of
```

## Step 4: Information Synthesis

```
# Research Synthesis Request

Based on all the information we've gathered about [RESEARCH_TOPIC], please create a comprehensive synthesis that:

1. Integrates key findings from all subtopics we've explored
2. Highlights important connections and patterns across different areas
3. Identifies emerging trends or future directions
4. Summarizes major debates or unresolved questions
5. Presents practical implications or applications of this knowledge

Structure this synthesis in a logical flow that would help someone new to the topic gain a comprehensive understanding while also offering depth for those more familiar with the subject.
```

## Step 5: Knowledge Gap Analysis

```
# Research Gap Analysis

Now that we've synthesized the available information on [RESEARCH_TOPIC], please help me identify gaps in our current understanding:

1. What important questions remain unanswered in our research?
2. Which areas have limited or conflicting evidence?
3. What perspectives or approaches might be underrepresented?
4. Which connections between subtopics need further exploration?
5. What practical applications require additional investigation?

For each gap identified, please suggest specific approaches or methods that could help address it in future research.
```

## Adapting This Workflow

This workflow can be customized for different research needs:
- Academic research
- Market analysis
- Product development
- Policy research
- Literature reviews

Adjust the prompts to match your specific domain and research goals.

> Note: This workflow benefits from models with strong knowledge bases and large context windows that can maintain the thread of the research conversation.
