## Quick Summary
**For beginners**: This document explains how to connect AI to external knowledge sources (like databases or documents) to make it smarter and more accurate.

**For practitioners**: A technical framework for implementing retrieval systems that enhance LLMs with external knowledge, including architecture designs and performance optimization.

**Key takeaway**: RAG systems can improve factual accuracy and domain-specific knowledge by connecting LLMs to external information sources at inference time.

```
# Advanced RAG Pipeline

1. Query Processing
   - Query understanding: [intent extraction + disambiguation + expansion]
   - Retrieval formulation: [query transformation + metadata filtering + retrieval parameters]
   - Multi-retrieval orchestration: [source prioritization + retrieval routing + fusion strategy]

2. Context Engineering
   - Relevance assessment: [semantic matching + contextual importance + recency weighting]
   - Context composition: [hierarchical organization + redundancy elimination + complementary assembly]
   - Context preparation: [size optimization + format standardization + reference annotation]

3. Augmentation Strategy
   - Generation framing: [task specification + context utilization guidance + output constraints]
   - Integration method: [direct context inclusion + chain-of-thought scaffolding + iterative refinement]
   - Verification system: [evidence linking + confidence assessment + information gaps identification]

4. Output Refinement

### Pattern Implementation Matrix
| RAG Pattern | Application Context | System Architecture | Potential Benefits |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| **Direct Context** | Factual QA, document grounding, explicit knowledge tasks | Query → single retrieval → context insertion → generation | May provide better precision, limited synthesis, supports attribution |
| **Iterative Retrieval** | Complex research, multi-hop reasoning, exploratory tasks | Initial query → generation → follow-up queries → synthesis | Can improve information coverage, supports gradual refinement, helps maintain thread coherence |
| **Recursive Retrieval-Generation** | Problem-solving, step-by-step analysis, structured output | Decomposition → targeted retrieval per subtask → progressive generation | Can enhance task completion, supports knowledge composition and structured exploration |
| **Self-Verification** | Critical applications, high-stakes domains, accuracy-sensitive tasks | Generation → verification query → fact-checking → refinement | May help with error reduction, confidence estimation, and uncertainty measurement |
| **Adaptive Retrieval** | Personalized responses, context-sensitive tasks, specialized domains | User modeling → retrieval customization → personalized generation | Can improve relevance precision, support domain adaptation and user alignment |

## Implementation Strategies

### Query Engineering
- **Decomposition techniques**: Breaking complex queries into retrievable components
- **Expansion methods**: Query enhancement with related terms, synonyms, or context
- **Meta-retrieval**: Retrieving information about what to retrieve
- **Iterative refinement**: Progressive query improvement based on intermediate results
