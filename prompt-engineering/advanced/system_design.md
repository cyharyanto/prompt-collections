# LLM System Architecture Framework

## Human-AI Collaborative Architecture Patterns
| Pattern | Human Role | AI Role | Key Components |
|---------|------------|---------|----------------|
| **RAG** | Information need definition + relevance evaluation | Information retrieval + synthesis | Vector DB + retrieval algorithm + context fusion + human verification |
| **CoT Orchestration** | Problem formulation + validity assessment | Step execution + connection identification | Task decomposition + intermediate reasoning + verification + human oversight |
| **Critiquing Loops** | Quality criteria definition + evaluation | Draft generation + revision | Draft generation + human evaluation criteria + iterative improvement |
| **HITL Systems** | Decision authority + edge case handling | Pattern processing + suggestion generation | Confidence thresholds + human interfaces + correction mechanisms + authority protocols |
| **Multi-agent** | System design + output evaluation | Specialized processing + information routing | Agent specialization + communication protocol + coordination system + human governance |

## System Components Specification

```
Input → [Processing] → Output

[Processing]:
1. Input Processing
   - Validation: type checking, security filtering, intent classification
   - Normalization: formatting, canonicalization, entity standardization
   
2. Context Management
   - Strategies: retrieval-based, conversation history, user profile integration
   - Implementation: windowing, summarization, prioritization algorithms
   
3. Prompt Engineering
   - Template system: parameterization, version control, A/B testing
   - Dynamic construction: context-aware selection, fallback hierarchies
   
4. Generation Pipeline
   - Model selection: task routing, cascade approach, ensemble methods
   - Parameter optimization: temperature management, constraint enforcement
   
5. Output Processing
   - Validation: fact-checking, security scanning, quality assessment
   - Formatting: structure enforcement, adaptation to delivery channel
   
6. Feedback Integration
   - Collection: explicit ratings, implicit signals, usage patterns
   - Application: model fine-tuning, prompt refinement, routing optimization
```

## Implementation Matrix

| Consideration | Trade-offs | Implementation Approaches |
|---------------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Model Selection** | Capability vs. cost/latency | Task-specific routing, cascade strategy, caching predictable outputs |
| **Latency** | Speed vs. quality | Pre-computation, parallel processing, streaming responses, progressive enhancement |
| **Cost** | Performance vs. budget | Caching, model distillation, query optimization, batching, hybrid token allocation |
| **Security** | Access vs. protection | Input/output filtering, PII detection, rate limiting, permission tiers |
| **Scalability** | Capacity vs. complexity | Horizontal scaling, load balancing, queue management, degradation strategies |

## Testing Framework
- **Functional testing**: Input-output contract validation, edge case handling, error recovery
- **Behavioral testing**: Adversarial inputs, bias evaluation, consistency assessment
- **Performance testing**: Latency profiling, throughput measurement, resource utilization
- **Integration testing**: Component interaction, API compatibility, dependency validation
- **Monitoring**: Response quality metrics, drift detection, outlier identification

## Human-AI Collaborative System Design: Customer Support Platform
```
Architecture: Human-centered RAG + HITL with clear human decision authority

Components:
1. Knowledge Base [Vector DB + metadata store]
   - Product documentation, policies, FAQ, past resolutions
   - Regular synchronization with source-of-truth systems
   - Human-verified information prioritization

2. Query Processing Pipeline
   - Human-defined intent classification: support category + urgency detection
   - Context extraction: customer history + product details
   - Human-guided query reformulation: decomposition + enhancement

3. Response Generation System
   - Retrieval mechanism: hybrid (sparse + dense) with re-ranking
   - Human-approved template selection: intent-based + customer segment rules
   - Human-defined personalization guidelines: tone adjustment + detail calibration
   - Citation generation: source tracking for human verification

4. Human Augmentation Interface [Primary decision authority]
   - Confidence scoring: uncertainty highlighting + evidence surfacing
   - Agent dashboard: suggestion display + edit capabilities + human judgment framework
   - Human expertise integration: domain knowledge application + value-based decisions
   - Escalation triggers: complexity thresholds + sentiment analysis + human-defined criteria

5. Collaborative Quality Assurance Framework
   - Human-defined quality standards: factual accuracy + policy compliance + customer satisfaction
   - Human review: sampling strategy + annotation system + feedback mechanism
   - Human leadership in improvement: directing system refinements based on outcomes
   - Value-aligned evaluation: measuring success through human-centered metrics

6. Human-AI Governance System
   - Oversight mechanisms: human review of edge cases and outliers
   - Feedback incorporation: structured capture of human agent insights
   - Authority protocols: clear delineation of decision boundaries
   - Continuous education: human agent training on effective collaboration

Implementation Requirements:
- Clear human oversight and ultimate decision authority
