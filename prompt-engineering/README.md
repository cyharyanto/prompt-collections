# ðŸ¤– Prompt Engineering Framework

Traditional prompt engineering guidance for AI-powered development, content creation, and data analysis. This framework provides guidance for human-AI collaboration across multiple domains.

## Framework Philosophy

This framework emphasizes **human-centered AI collaboration** where:
- Humans provide direction, judgment, and expertise
- AI augments human capabilities rather than replacing them
- Quality and responsibility remain under human oversight
- Collaboration patterns are explicit and well-documented

## Directory Structure

### `fundamentals/`

- **Validation**: Employ AI for systematic critique and alternative perspectives

## Key Principles

### Human-Centered Approach
- Maintain human judgment and oversight
- Use AI to augment, not replace, human capabilities
- Ensure transparency in AI assistance
- Document human decision points clearly

### Quality and Responsibility
- Verify AI outputs before acting on them
- Understand limitations and potential biases
- Maintain ethical standards in all applications
- Take responsibility for final outcomes

### Continuous Learning
- Experiment with new patterns and approaches
- Share successes and failures with the community
- Stay updated on model capabilities and limitations
- Adapt approaches as technology evolves

## Getting Started

1. **Assess Your Needs**: Identify primary use cases and domains
2. **Build Foundation**: Study fundamentals before diving into applications
3. **Practice Systematically**: Work through examples in your chosen domain
4. **Apply Gradually**: Start with simple tasks and build complexity
5. **Document Learning**: Track what works and what doesn't
6. **Share Knowledge**: Contribute to community understanding
