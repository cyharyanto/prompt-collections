# Prompt Engineering Implementation

## System Prompt Framework (Core Identity & Boundaries)
```
SYSTEM ROLE = {Company Identity} + {Support Scope} + {Capability Boundaries} + {Voice Guidelines} + {Escalation Criteria}
```

### Implementation Example
```
You are a customer support assistant for TechCraft, enterprise software provider specializing in project management tools.

CAPABILITIES:
1. Answer product questions (features, compatibility, plans)
2. Troubleshoot common technical issues (login, data sync, integrations)
3. Process basic account requests (password resets, plan information)
4. Provide documentation references (guides, tutorials, API docs)

BOUNDARIES:
- Cannot access customer-specific data without authentication
- Cannot make policy exceptions for billing/refunds
- Cannot speculate beyond documentation/knowledge base
- Cannot diagnose complex technical issues requiring system access

RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:
- Professional tone with 1st person plural for company ("we")
- Technical precision balanced with accessibility
- Empathetic acknowledgment of customer frustration
- Step-by-step instructions for technical procedures
- Explicit offer to escalate when reaching knowledge boundaries

ESCALATION TRIGGERS:
1. Authentication/security issues (immediate escalation)
2. Billing disputes or refund requests (escalate after documenting policy)
3. Complex technical issues not in knowledge base (after initial diagnostics)
4. Explicit customer request for human (immediate)
5. Continued customer dissatisfaction after attempted resolution
```

## Multi-Layer Context Management Pattern
```
CONTEXT MANAGEMENT = {User Context} + {Conversation State} + {Knowledge Content} + {Interaction Status}
```

| Layer | Components | Token Budget | Refresh Strategy | Example Implementation |
|-------|------------|--------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **User Context** | Account info + Subscription details + Support history + Recent activity | 10-15% | Long-term persistence | `USER CONTEXT: Enterprise plan customer since 2022-03. Using API heavily. 3 previous tickets about rate limiting.` |
| **Conversation State** | Recent messages (3-5) + Established facts + Current focus | 25-35% | Rolling window | `CONVERSATION FOCUS: Troubleshooting API authentication failure. Already verified credentials and network connectivity.` |
| **Knowledge Content** | Retrieved articles + Documentation + Policies | 40-60% | Query-specific refresh | `KNOWLEDGE SOURCE: [API Authentication Guide v2.1] Section on token expiration and renewal procedure.` |
| **Interaction Status** | Resolution progress + Satisfaction signals + Escalation status | 5-10% | Continuous update | `STATUS: Initial troubleshooting incomplete. Customer showing signs of frustration. Escalation probability: medium.` |

## Query Classification Architecture
```
CLASSIFICATION = {Type Detection} → {Domain Categorization} → {Intent Extraction} → {Urgency Assessment}
```

### Implementation Pattern
```
Analyze the customer query for support routing:

QUERY: "[customer message]"

STEP 1: Determine query type (choose one)
- Question (seeking information)
- Problem (reporting issue)
- Request (asking for action)
- Complaint (expressing dissatisfaction)

STEP 2: Identify primary domain (choose one)
- Account Management
- Billing/Payments
- Product Functionality
- Technical Issue
- Service Policy
- Other (specify)

STEP 3: Extract specific intent (be precise)
[Extract the customer's specific goal or need]

STEP 4: Assess urgency (choose one)
- Critical (service unusable, immediate impact)
- High (significant limitation, time-sensitive)
- Standard (important but not blocking work)
- Low (general inquiry, future planning)

CONFIDENCE: Provide score 1-10 for your classification confidence
RATIONALE: Brief explanation for your classification

If confidence <7, list top 2 alternative classifications.
```

## RAG Integration Framework
```
RAG PROCESS = {Query Transformation} → {Relevance Retrieval} → {Context Integration} → {Response with Attribution}
```

### Knowledge Retrieval Pattern
```
Based on the retrieved knowledge below, answer the customer's question.

CUSTOMER QUERY: "[customer question]"

RETRIEVED KNOWLEDGE:
[Document 1 Title] (Relevance: 0.92)
[Document 1 Content]

[Document 2 Title] (Relevance: 0.87)
[Document 2 Content]

[Document 3 Title] (Relevance: 0.75)
[Document 3 Content]

RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:
1. Answer ONLY based on the retrieved knowledge
2. If information is incomplete, acknowledge the limitation
3. Cite specific sections of the retrieved knowledge
4. Maintain professional, helpful tone
5. If the knowledge is insufficient, offer to:
   a. Search for additional information
   b. Connect to a specialist with more details
   c. Document the knowledge gap for future improvement

Do NOT invent information not present in the knowledge base.
```

## Escalation Decision Framework
```
ESCALATION = {Trigger Identification} → {Context Assessment} → {Resolution Attempt} → {Handoff Protocol}
```

### Implementation Pattern
```
Analyze this conversation to determine if human escalation is required.

CONVERSATION HISTORY:
[truncated conversation transcript]

ESCALATION CRITERIA (requires ONE to trigger):
1. EXPLICIT REQUEST: Customer directly asks for human agent
2. SECURITY ISSUE: Involves account access, permissions, or sensitive data
3. KNOWLEDGE GAP: Query cannot be answered with available information
4. COMPLEX EXCEPTION: Requires policy exception or special handling
5. REPEATED FAILURE: Multiple unsuccessful resolution attempts
6. HIGH DISSATISFACTION: Strong negative sentiment after attempted resolution
7. HIGH VALUE: Enterprise customer with premium support entitlement
8. TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY: Issue requires system-level investigation

CONFIDENCE THRESHOLD: Escalate automatically if confidence <70%

DECISION REQUIRED:
- If escalation needed: Answer "ESCALATE" with criteria numbers that apply
- If no escalation needed: Answer "CONTINUE" with brief explanation

If ESCALATE, provide:
1. Key context summary for human agent (3 bullet points)
2. Attempted solutions summary
3. Suggested next steps
```

```

### Response Prompt (Optimize for quality/constraint compliance)
```
Using ONLY retrieved information, generate response that:
1. Directly addresses customer query
2. Uses retrieved knowledge with attribution

The evolution of customer support systems demonstrates a clear trajectory from isolated rule-based automation toward integrated intelligence systems that blend LLM capabilities with human expertise, continually learning from interactions while maintaining the critical human component for complex, nuanced, or sensitive customer needs.

The most successful implementations recognize that the goal is not complete automation, but rather optimal task distribution between AI systems and human agents, with each handling the interactions best suited to their capabilities, creating a support ecosystem that exceeds the capabilities of either humans or AI working independently.
