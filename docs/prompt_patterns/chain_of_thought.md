# Chain of Thought Prompting

This document explores chain of thought prompting techniques for improved reasoning.

## What is Chain of Thought?

Chain of Thought (CoT) is a prompting technique that encourages LLMs to break down complex problems into step-by-step reasoning.

## Implementing CoT

- Basic Chain of Thought
- Zero-shot Chain of Thought
- Few-shot Chain of Thought
- Self-consistency methods

## Applications

- Mathematical reasoning
- Logical problem solving
- Complex decision making
- Code generation and debugging

## Examples

```
Task: Solve the following math problem

To solve this effectively, think through this step by step:
1. Identify the key variables
2. Set up the equations
3. Solve systematically
4. Verify your answer

Problem: If a store sells shirts for $15 each and offers a "buy 2, get 1 free" promotion, how much would 7 shirts cost?
