# Few-Shot Learning Techniques

This document explores few-shot learning approaches for improved LLM task performance.

## What is Few-Shot Learning?

Few-shot learning involves providing examples to help LLMs understand the pattern of the task you want them to perform.

## Implementing Few-Shot Prompts

- Selecting representative examples
- Formatting examples consistently
- Balancing example complexity and count
- Ordering strategies for examples

## Applications

- Classification tasks
- Format transformation
- Style matching
- Domain-specific tasks

## Example Structure

```
Input: [First example input]
Output: [First example output]

Input: [Second example input]
Output: [Second example output]

Input: [Your actual input]
Output: ?
```
