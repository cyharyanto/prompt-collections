# Educational Prompt Engineering

## Design Principles
| Principle | Implementation | Evaluation Metrics |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Learner-centered** | Task complexity matching, knowledge calibration, interest integration | Engagement rate, completion success, self-reported clarity |
| **Scaffolded learning** | Progressive complexity, guided practice, fading support | Independent application success, reduced assistance needs |
| **Assessment integration** | Knowledge checks, misconception detection, metacognitive prompts | Accuracy trends, retention rates, transfer ability |
| **Engagement optimization** | Curiosity triggers, relevance hooks, cognitive activation | Time-on-task, voluntary continuation, participatory behavior |

## Technical Application Matrix

| Learning Objective | Prompt Structure | Example Implementation |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Concept acquisition** | Definition → examples → non-examples → application | `Explain [concept] in basic terms → Provide diverse examples → Contrast with similar concepts → Guide application to novel situation` |
| **Procedural mastery** | Step breakdown → critical decision points → error detection → self-monitoring | `Decompose [procedure] into steps → Highlight decision criteria → Present common errors → Suggest self-verification techniques` |
| **Critical analysis** | Multiple perspectives → evaluation framework → evidence assessment → synthesis | `Present [topic] from perspectives X,Y,Z → Provide analytical criteria → Guide evidence evaluation → Facilitate integrated conclusion` |
| **Creative development** | Constraint specification → divergent exploration → evaluation criteria → iterative refinement | `Define [creative task] parameters → Generate diverse approaches → Apply assessment rubric → Guide improvement process` |

## Implementation Patterns

### Explanation Optimization
```
# Multi-level Explanation Framework for [Topic]

Level 1: Foundational (8-10 year comprehension)
- Core concept: [simplified definition with concrete analogy]
- Key terms: [max 3-5 essential terms with plain language definitions]
- Visual model: [description of intuitive visual representation]
- Real-world connection: [everyday example relevant to young learners]

Level 2: Intermediate (12-14 year comprehension)
- Extended definition: [more precise terminology with key relationships]
- Process explanation: [causality and mechanism with some technical terms]
- Contextual factors: [important variables and conditions]
- Application examples: [relevant scenarios with increasing complexity]

Level 3: Advanced (16+ year comprehension)
- Technical definition: [discipline-specific terminology and precision]
- Theoretical framework: [underlying principles and models]
- Interrelationships: [connections to adjacent concepts/systems]
- Limitations and extensions: [boundary conditions and advanced applications]

Level 4: Expert (undergraduate+ level)
- Mathematical/formal representation: [equations, formal notation, technical models]
- Research context: [historical development and current understanding]
- Domain-specific nuances: [specialized applications and edge cases]
- Open questions: [unresolved issues and research directions]
```

### Assessment Construction
```
# Comprehensive Assessment Design for [Subject]

Topic: [specific learning objective]
Cognitive levels: [specify Bloom's taxonomy levels targeted]

## Knowledge Verification
1. Recall questions (weighted 20%)
   - Term-definition matching: [key terminology]
   - Basic fact identification: [core facts/principles]
   - Sequence recognition: [procedural steps/chronology]

2. Comprehension assessment (weighted 30%)
   - Explanation prompts: "Explain how/why [concept] works"
   - Example identification: "Which scenario demonstrates [principle]?"
   - Transformation tasks: "Translate [representation] to [different format]"

3. Application challenges (weighted 30%)
   - Problem-solving tasks: "Using [concept], solve [novel scenario]"
   - Case analysis: "Apply [framework] to analyze [specific case]"
   - Prediction exercises: "What would happen if [variables changed]?"

4. Higher-order thinking (weighted 20%)
   - Evaluation tasks: "Assess the validity of [claim] using [criteria]"
   - Creation prompts: "Design a solution for [complex problem]"
   - Integration challenges: "Synthesize [multiple concepts] to explain [phenomenon]"

Differentiation strategies:
- Support scaffolds: [specific supports for struggling learners]
- Extension options: [challenge pathways for advanced learners]
- Alternative demonstrations: [multiple modalities for showing mastery]
