# Domain-Specific Prompt Engineering

This directory contains guidance for prompt engineering in specific domains. Each domain has unique considerations, patterns, and best practices.

## Available Domains

### [Coding](coding/)
Strategies for working with AI code assistants, including code generation, analysis, debugging, and documentation.

### [Writing](writing/)
Techniques for content creation, editing, style adaptation, and various writing formats.

### [Data Analysis](data_analysis/)
Approaches for working with datasets, generating insights, visualization suggestions, and data-driven storytelling.

### [Education](education/)
Methods for creating educational content, tutoring interactions, learning materials, and assessment tools.

## Cross-Domain Principles

While each domain has unique aspects, several principles apply across all domains:

1. **Clarity**: Be specific about what you want
2. **Context**: Provide necessary background information
3. **Constraints**: Specify limitations and requirements
4. **Examples**: Show examples of desired outputs when possible
5. **Iteration**: Refine prompts based on results

## How to Use These Guides

Each domain guide follows a similar structure:
- Core principles for that domain
- Specific techniques and patterns
- Common applications
- Example prompts and templates

Start with the domain most relevant to your work, but don't hesitate to explore techniques from other domains as they often can be adapted for different purposes.
