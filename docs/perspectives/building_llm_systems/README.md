## Quick Summary
**For beginners**: LLM-powered applications require architectures that extract user intent, integrate domain knowledge, and implement recovery pathways—moving beyond individual prompts to systematic prompt infrastructures.

**For practitioners**: Production LLM systems demand engineering approaches to prompt design: versioning, testing, monitoring, and continuous improvement of modular prompt components that function as distributed inference architecture.

**Key takeaway**: System robustness correlates directly with structured prompt engineering that anticipates user behavior variation, grounds responses in domain knowledge, and implements graceful degradation paths.
