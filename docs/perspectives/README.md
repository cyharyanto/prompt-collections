## Quick Summary
**For beginners**: Two distinct approaches to prompt engineering exist: direct LLM use (optimizing individual interactions) versus system building (creating applications where others interact with LLMs)—each requiring fundamentally different skills and considerations.

**For practitioners**: These perspectives represent a critical separation of concerns with divergent architectural patterns, risk models, and optimization strategies that determine both implementation approaches and evaluation methodologies.

**Key takeaway**: Strategic prompt engineering requires contextualizing techniques within the appropriate perspective—individual optimization for direct use versus systematic robustness for application development.
