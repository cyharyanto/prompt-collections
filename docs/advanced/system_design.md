# LLM System Architecture

## Architecture Patterns
| Pattern | Application | Key Components |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **RAG** | Knowledge-intensive tasks | Vector DB + retrieval algorithm + context fusion |
| **CoT Orchestration** | Complex reasoning | Task decomposition + intermediate reasoning + verification |
| **Critiquing Loops** | Output refinement | Draft generation + evaluation criteria + iterative improvement |
| **HITL Systems** | Critical applications | Confidence thresholds + human interfaces + correction mechanisms |
| **Multi-agent** | Specialized workflows | Agent specialization + communication protocol + coordination system |

## System Components Specification

```
Input → [Processing] → Output

[Processing]:
1. Input Processing
   - Validation: type checking, security filtering, intent classification
   - Normalization: formatting, canonicalization, entity standardization
   
2. Context Management
   - Strategies: retrieval-based, conversation history, user profile integration
   - Implementation: windowing, summarization, prioritization algorithms
   
3. Prompt Engineering
   - Template system: parameterization, version control, A/B testing
   - Dynamic construction: context-aware selection, fallback hierarchies
   
4. Generation Pipeline
   - Model selection: task routing, cascade approach, ensemble methods
   - Parameter optimization: temperature management, constraint enforcement
   
5. Output Processing
   - Validation: fact-checking, security scanning, quality assessment
   - Formatting: structure enforcement, adaptation to delivery channel
   
6. Feedback Integration
   - Collection: explicit ratings, implicit signals, usage patterns
   - Application: model fine-tuning, prompt refinement, routing optimization
```

## Implementation Matrix

| Consideration | Trade-offs | Implementation Approaches |
|---------------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Model Selection** | Capability vs. cost/latency | Task-specific routing, cascade strategy, caching predictable outputs |
| **Latency** | Speed vs. quality | Pre-computation, parallel processing, streaming responses, progressive enhancement |
| **Cost** | Performance vs. budget | Caching, model distillation, query optimization, batching, hybrid token allocation |
| **Security** | Access vs. protection | Input/output filtering, PII detection, rate limiting, permission tiers |
| **Scalability** | Capacity vs. complexity | Horizontal scaling, load balancing, queue management, degradation strategies |

## Testing Framework
- **Functional testing**: Input-output contract validation, edge case handling, error recovery
- **Behavioral testing**: Adversarial inputs, bias evaluation, consistency assessment
- **Performance testing**: Latency profiling, throughput measurement, resource utilization
- **Integration testing**: Component interaction, API compatibility, dependency validation
- **Monitoring**: Response quality metrics, drift detection, outlier identification

## System Design Pattern: Customer Support Agent
```
Architecture: RAG + HITL with escalation paths

Components:
1. Knowledge Base [Vector DB + metadata store]
   - Product documentation, policies, FAQ, past resolutions
   - Regular synchronization with source-of-truth systems

2. Query Processing Pipeline
   - Intent classification: support category + urgency detection
   - Context extraction: customer history + product details
   - Query reformulation: decomposition + enhancement

3. Response Generation System
   - Retrieval mechanism: hybrid (sparse + dense) with re-ranking
   - Template selection: intent-based + customer segment rules
   - Personalization layer: tone adjustment + detail calibration

4. Human Augmentation Interface
   - Confidence scoring: uncertainty highlighting + evidence surfacing
   - Agent dashboard: suggestion display + edit capabilities
   - Escalation triggers: complexity thresholds + sentiment analysis

5. Quality Assurance Framework
   - Automated checks: factual accuracy + policy compliance
   - Human review: sampling strategy + annotation system
   - Feedback loop: continuous improvement mechanism

Implementation Requirements:
- Authentication integration with existing customer systems
- Sub-second retrieval for common queries
- Privacy filtering for PII/sensitive data
- Conversation history with multi-turn capability
- Explicit source attribution for all factual claims
