# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This document explores strategies for effectively combining LLMs with retrieval systems.

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach that combines the generation capabilities of LLMs with the ability to retrieve information from external knowledge sources.

## Key Components

- Query formulation
- Retrieval mechanisms
- Context integration
- Response generation

## Implementation Strategies

- Prompt construction for retrieval
- Context window management
- Hybrid approaches
- Self-verification techniques

## Applications

- Question answering
- Document-grounded generation
- Knowledge-intensive tasks
- Factual consistency

## Example Prompts

```
Task: Answer questions using retrieved context

You are a research assistant helping to answer questions about [domain]. 
I will provide you with:
1. A question
2. Relevant information retrieved from a knowledge base

Your task is to:
1. Use ONLY the information I provide to answer the question
2. If the retrieved information is insufficient, clearly state what's missing
3. Cite the specific source from the retrieved information
4. Do not introduce information that isn't in the retrieved context

Question: [question]

Retrieved information:
[retrieved context]
